        <h2>Physical Appearance and Clothing</h2>
        <div class="image_2">
            <p>
                Goku looks similar to his father, Bardock, with a fit body and visible muscle definition, including four abdominal muscles. In the original manga and anime, he has a crab-like hairstyle with black hair, black eyebrows, and black pupils. When transformed into a Super Saiyan, his hair stands up except for the bangs, with yellow hair and eyebrows, and green pupils. When he reaches Super Saiyan 3, his golden hair grows to his waist, his eyebrows disappear, and his pupils become a lighter shade of green with a deeper blue iris. In Dragon Ball Super, when he becomes a Super Saiyan God, his hair turns bright red, his body becomes leaner, his eyes larger with visible pupils, and his skin becomes fairer, giving him a youthful appearance. When he evolves into a Super Saiyan Blue, his hair, eyebrows, and pupils turn fluorescent blue, standing up except for the bangs. In his Ultra Instinct form, his hair shows silver lines, and his pupils turn silver. When he fully masters the human state, his hair turns completely silver. In Dragon Ball GT, when he evolves into a Super Saiyan 4, his hair reaches his shoulders, he grows red body hair except on his chest, a tail on his butt, and he transforms from a child back into an adult.

                As a child, Goku mostly wears a blue-purple (red in the color version of the manga) martial arts uniform or a white vest with no patterns, blue pants, and black training shoes, a white belt, and carries a Ruyi Bang. When participating in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku wears an orange Kame School uniform with a circle around the "turtle" character on the heart and a larger "turtle" character on the back, with blue wristbands. At this time, Goku no longer carries the Ruyi Bang.
                During the early part of Dragon Ball Z, Goku wears a blue heavy vest over a Turtle School uniform, with blue boots that have a yellow line down the center, and blue wristbands (both the boots and wristbands are heavy clothing), and a blue belt. After being revived on King Kai's planet, his clothes are still Turtle School uniforms, but the character on the back is changed to "King Kai," and the vest and wristbands return to normal weight. When he arrives on Namek, Goku still wears a blue vest and Turtle School uniform, but the characters on the heart and back are changed to "Goku."
            </p>
            <p>
                After returning from Yardrat, Goku wears Yardrat's clothes: a white loose long-sleeved shirt, yellow and blue wristbands, a half-slanted blue-black chest armor on his chest, a shoulder guard on his left shoulder, a white bandage around his waist, a diagonal belt, and orange pants and blue boots. During the Android Saga, Goku and Gohan enter the Time Chamber for training wearing the same combat uniforms as Vegeta.
                In the middle and late parts of Dragon Ball Z, he still wears a blue vest and Turtle School uniform, but the heart and back have no characters, and the belt is not tied but wrapped around his waist. He mostly dresses this way, but sometimes wears clothes with the "Goku" character.
            </p>
            <p>
                During his training with Whis, his clothes also change significantly. He no longer wears a blue vest but wears an orange training suit with Whis's logo on the heart, a blue belt, dark blue wristbands, and blue Velcro boots. Ten years after defeating Buu, Goku wears a blue training suit and dark blue (khaki in GT) loose pants, with bandages on his wrists and ankles, black training shoes, and a white belt.
                Sometimes Goku also wears other clothes. When Goku goes to learn to drive, he wears a patterned casual shirt. In the early stages of the Cell Games, when accompanying his family, he wears a white undershirt and an orange-black jacket. In the God and God arc, Goku also wears a blue and white sports suit and sneakers when training on King Kai's planet.

        <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
        <div class="image_2">
            <p>
                Innocent, Goku is always willing to trust others in battle and is easily confused by one-sided words. It is difficult for him to distinguish between good and evil, which has led to many losses in battle (for example, when the 6th and 7th Universes held a martial arts competition, Goku trusted Frost just because he was friendly and greeted others in the 7th Universe, and finally lost the competition due to Frost's poison needle). This has both advantages and disadvantages. Because of his innocence, Goku can be immune to the devil light of the devil people, and he can also ride the somersault cloud.
            </p>
            <p>
               Kind-hearted, Goku has a soft heart and will not easily take people's lives (unless they are like Piccolo Daimao, Cell, Majin Buu, or Zamasu, who want to destroy or conquer the world). Although he is a good warrior, the battle often stops at the point, and he will not take the initiative to kill his opponents, or hope that he can stay and have the opportunity to fight in the future (for example, when Vegeta was killed by Frieza on Namek, Goku buried him with his own hands, saying that although Vegeta was annoying, he admitted that he was the glory of the Saiyans, and he was proud of it. When Frieza was dying from his own moves and begged Goku to save him, Goku gave him some of his energy to survive.
                After killing Kid Buu, he also prayed to the King of Hell, hoping to meet Buu again and let him be reincarnated, which led to the birth of Uub).
            </p>
            <p>
                Warrior-like, Goku is a martial arts maniac. Whenever there is a strong opponent, he will feel excited. Whether it is from Latimer's mouth that there are two strongest Saiyans, or on Namek, there is a stronger aura than Vegeta, which makes him both sad and happy. He pursues fair competition. When the martial arts were disabled by Piccolo, and the gods proposed to attack Piccolo, Goku opposed it because it was a competition. When the Cell Games, the partners thought that Gohan could fight with the partially体力消耗的沙鲁, Goku took the initiative to give the sand bean to the sand to seek fairness. When fighting with Hit, in order to let him use his true strength, he asked the referee to cancel the "cannot kill the contestant" rule.
            </p>
            <p>
               Diligent, he is a "crazy" practitioner.
