                Long, long ago, there was an ancient legend that in this world, there are seven round balls called Dragon Balls scattered everywhere. As long as you collect all seven Dragon Balls and chant the spell, you can summon the Shenron, who will help you realize any wish. So Son Goku and Bulma set out to find the Dragon Balls together.
