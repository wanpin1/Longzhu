        <div class="image_2">
            <p>
                Trunks has a combination of his parents' features, with hair quality similar to his mother and facial features like his father. Future Trunks is described as a handsome young man with a melancholic aura. His height increased significantly after training in the Spirit and Time Room. In terms of hair and eye color, both Future and Present Trunks have light purple hair and eyes, but in the Dragon Ball Super TV series, they are distinguished, with Future Trunks having the same aqua blue hair and eyes as Bulma. In terms of clothing, Future Trunks first appeared wearing a purple (or dark blue) jacket with the Capsule Corporation logo, a black vest underneath, and a one-handed sword on his back as a weapon. In Dragon Ball Super, he switched to a blue jacket and wore a red scarf, later temporarily changing to an olive green sweater. When entering the Spirit and Time Room for training, he wore the same combat uniform as Vegeta. Present Trunks first appeared in a green training suit, with orange and red wristbands, and as an adult, he wore a light brown jacket, a black vest, a blue scarf, and brown gloves, and wore a brown suit when working, and other casual clothes during his leisure time.

        <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
        <div class="image_2">
            <p>
                Trunks is a champion of good, fighting against evil. When Earth was devastated by Androids and only tens of thousands of people remained, he used the time machine built by his mother Bulma to travel back in time to defeat the Androids and bring peace to the past (Future).
                He is loyal and righteous, during the battle with Cell, he lost to Cell due to his slow speed (Super Saiyan 3), and even though he knew he would die, he did not reveal the secret of the Spirit and Time Room under Cell's interrogation (Future).
            </p>
            <p>
                Trunks is filial and hardworking. When fighting Cell with Vegeta for the first time, he knew his father had a strong sense of pride, so he never showed his true strength, all for his father's pride (Future). Also, when Vegeta was nearly killed by Majin Buu, he rushed out to save his father without hesitation (Present).
                He is cautious and decisive, never showing mercy to his enemies. When Frieza, after being revived by his father, came to Earth to avenge against Goku, Future Trunks intercepted and easily killed him. In the Android Saga, when Vegeta once tried to release the Androids and help Cell become a complete body, Trunks desperately stopped him, leaving no hidden dangers (Future).
                Indomitable, facing the repeated attacks and brainwashing of Future Zamasu and Black Goku, Trunks persisted, determined to protect humanity and not be confused or defeated by Zamasu's "god" rhetoric, ultimately winning the victory with the persistence of himself and others (Future).
            </p>
            <p>
                Trunks is somewhat pessimistic and disheartened, bearing the burden of saving the future alone and the pain of losing loved ones repeatedly, making him a bit more negative than Present Trunks (Future).
                He is hasty in judgment, in the battle with Perfect Cell, he thought he had reached a level that other Saiyans could not reach (Super Saiyan 3), and challenged Cell, only to be defeated by Cell's speed advantage, understanding why Goku and Vegeta did not use this form (Future).
                Frank and honest, after Vegito (the fusion of Trunks and Goten) attacked Majin Buu and turned back into Trunks and Goten, he did not think of escaping immediately, but thought of using candy to apologize to Buu (Present).
                He is complacent, like his father, he has the habit of provoking his opponents in battle. In the movie "The Explosive Power of Dragon Ball," Vegito (the fusion of Trunks and Goten) fought against the Illusion Magician, thinking that the fusion could surpass Goku's Super Saiyan 3 in normal state, but was scattered by the Illusion Magician due to arrogance (Present).
            </p>
            <p>
                Intelligent and clever, in GT, Trunks used his wisdom to destroy Dr. Myu's computer (Present).
