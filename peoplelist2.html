            <p>
                In the original work (manga and anime), Vegeta has angular cheeks, inherited his father King Vegeta's hairstyle and appearance, and also inherited his father's physical characteristics and part of his personality. He has a high and smooth forehead, a row of sharp bangs when he was a child, a prominent eyebrow when he grew up, heart-shaped temples, wide eyebrows and long eyes, slightly dark at the corners of his eyes, fierce eyes, high and upright flame-like black hair (the red hair in the Z anime was a coloring error), strong eyebrows, deep eyes, and enlarged pupils in the later stages, representing Vegeta's own mental changes. He has a straight and straight nose, and often shows a trace of evil charm at the corner of his mouth. In the GT period, there have been great changes, his hair was cut short, and he also had a beard, which was scraped off after being disliked by Bulma.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the "Android Saga", when he transforms into a Super Saiyan, his hair and eyebrows turn golden, and his pupils turn green, but his hairstyle does not change. In the "Majin Buu Saga", when he is transformed into a Super Saiyan by Babidi's magic, the word "M" appears on his forehead, and a large number of blue veins pop out, at this time the eye socket turns black.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the "Black Goku Saga" (manga), when he becomes a Super Saiyan God, his hairstyle does not change, his hair color is bright red, his body becomes thinner, his eyes become larger and show pupils, his skin becomes fairer, and his appearance becomes youthful; in the "Universal Survival Saga", when he becomes a Super Saiyan Blue, his hair color, eyebrow color, and pupil color turn fluorescent blue; in the "Granolah Saga", when he is in the state of self-ease, his hair color turns purple, his eyebrows lower and disappear, and his face becomes relatively thin.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the "Baby Saga", when he was possessed by Baby, vertical lines appeared on his chin and above his eyes. When Baby became a Super Saiyan, Vegeta's hair color changed from black to silver, and his pupils turned red. In the "Evil Dragon Saga", when he evolved into a Super Saiyan 4, his hair grew long and draped from his neck to his chest, his hair color was ordinary black with a touch of red, his pupils were green, his shoulders and back were covered with red body hair, and he grew a tail.

        <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
        <div class="image_2">
            <p>
                Vegeta is a Saiyan prince with extremely high self-esteem, cold, competitive, and arrogant. He considers himself the strongest Saiyan warrior and has the blood of the Saiyan royal family. In the early stage, he often looked down on lower-class warriors because of his royal status. He initially had the ambition to dominate the universe, but after meeting Goku, his character gradually changed. He ended the pursuit of conquering the universe and continuously took surpassing Goku as his personal goal. In the middle stage, he was both good and evil, often opposing Goku, and never liked to listen to others' advice. He was a proud warrior. In the later stage, his proud personality gradually converged, he loved Bulma deeply, and played the role of a good husband and a good man.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has clear love and hate, and values emotions and righteousness. When the Earth is invaded and destroyed, he will fight the enemy desperately, and when he encounters a strong enemy, he will take the lead and fight to protect his family (for example, when fighting Majin Buu, he learned to sacrifice himself and fight desperately to protect the public). Sometimes he will join hands with Goku to fight against the enemy, but he resists merging with Goku. He vows to be stronger than Goku and hopes to defeat Goku with his own hands one day. He regards Goku as a comrade-in-arms and an opponent, and likes to call him by his Saiyan name, Kakarot.
            </p>
            <p>
                He attaches great importance to his family and loves his son Trunks very much, although he never shows it too directly to Trunks. However, he cares very much about his son's gains and losses. For example, in the battle between Trunks and Goten, when Trunks won, Vegeta patted Goku's shoulder and said, "Facts have proved that my son's blood is superior," which reflects his mentality as an ordinary father who is proud of his son.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for friends and family, although Vegeta does not admit it, they are still very important in his heart. He was originally unwilling to accept the fusion, but he had to accept it after hearing Goku say that everyone was killed. After moving to the King of the World, he questioned Goku why he did not save Trunks first but went to save Satan and the dog. So he is a person who is cold on the outside but hot on the inside. Although he always has a hard time with Goku, he often saves him from danger. This seems to be due to his desire to defeat him with his own hands, but in fact, it is a respect and care for a true confidant.
