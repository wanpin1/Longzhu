            <p>
                Before the serialization began, there were many twists and turns. Akira Toriyama and the editor in charge, Kazuhiko Torishima, thought that the one-shot gag work "Dr. Slump" which was about to end in one more chapter, could not easily end such a popular work. If it ended the serialization three months later, it would be fine to resign. Under this condition, while serializing "Dr. Slump", he also started drawing one-shot works "Dragon Boy" and "Tonpoo's Adventure", and established the theme of "Dragon Ball" with these two works.
            </p>
            <p>
                The work initially adopted elements from "Journey to the West", and the idea of "collecting beads" was borrowed from the work "The Tales of the Eight Dogs of the Inaba", but changed the 8 beads in the Eight Dogs to 7.
            </p>
            <p>
                The title was borrowed from Bruce Lee's movie "Enter the Dragon". In this way, the initial framework of the work was established.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, it was intended to develop the plot according to Toriyama's version of "Journey to the West", but the editor in charge, Kazuhiko Torishima, thought "This is no different from the original Journey to the West" and reacted coldly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, in the second draft, modern-style clothing was added, and the third draft was already very close to the real "Dragon Ball". In the end, only the names and character designs of the protagonists in "Journey to the West", as well as a few early episodes and items, were retained.
            </p>
            <h2>Serial History</h2>
            <p>
                The work that started with a continuous five-week full-color serialization was not very popular at the beginning. It was originally expected by many people, but its popularity gradually declined, and the ranking in the survey questionnaire also dropped to below 15th. The person in charge, Toriyama, suggested that "the protagonist is too ordinary, that's why it's not popular", and then Akira Toriyama created with the theme of "a protagonist who pursues strength wholeheartedly".
            </p>
            <p>
                From this idea, the supporting roles were weakened, and to show the results of the modification, the World Martial Arts Tournament was created, which established Goku's position as the protagonist, and the popularity of the work also rose rapidly. At the same time, Fuji TV also came to Shueisha to discuss the issue of making a TV animation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Toriyama himself originally intended to end the story after Goku and Piccolo fought in the martial arts tournament, but due to the overwhelming popularity in the reader survey, the editorial department would not agree to end the serialization so simply, so he had to continue the serialization. When it came to the Frieza chapter, the popularity was even more explosive, and in the 1000-vote survey form held by "Weekly Shonen Jump" at that time, it received 815 votes.
            </p>
            <img class="about3" src="./images/about3.png" alt="">
            <p>
                In terms of economic effects, due to overseas distribution translations and the broadcast of animations, the popularity has not only expanded within Japan but also worldwide. One example is that a card game of the work "Carddas Dragon Ball Series" sold more than 2 billion copies by 1995, setting a record. If the serialization were to end, not only would the circulation of JUMP be directly affected, but the performance and stock prices of manufacturers at the center of the comprehensive media effect, such as Shueisha, Bandai, Fuji TV, Toei Animation, and other companies with various business dealings with the work, would also be greatly affected. Considering this possibility, a situation where serialization could not be ended at all was formed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding the end of the work, although it was out of Toriyama's personal strong desire, it was finally realized after various related companies held meetings at the higher level for adjustment, and the leaders of various companies made judgments on the business situation, controlling the stock prices and performance of various related companies to the minimum loss and other various considerations and preparations, forming an unprecedented situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, Toriyama said about the Majin Buu chapter, "This part of the story has become a continuous fierce battle that even the author himself is tired of, and now I have become an uncle with high blood pressure, and I can't draw such a fight anymore. Not to mention, I won't want to draw a fight in the future." Before the Buu chapter started, Toriyama had already agreed with Shueisha to end the serialization after the Buu chapter, and the then chief editor Horie Nobuhiko didn't know about it later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under such a background, the work became a long-term serialized work that lasted for 10 and a half years. There was no advance notice when the serialization ended, and the last episode ended with Goku continuing his adventure.

                "Dragon Ball" is one of the most widely influential Japanese comics in China and is the proud work of Japanese cartoonist Akira Toriyama. The story leads readers from the mountain village to the city, from Earth to outer space, and from the present to the future, with both exciting fights and sincere emotions. (Tencent Comment)

                The success of "Dragon Ball" is unprecedented. It not only made the sales of "Shonen Jump" surpass "Shonen Magazine" and reached a historical high of 6.53 million, but also influenced the subsequent Japanese comic pattern, giving birth to the concept of "king's road manga" in the youth's blood manga. In the manga about the life of a cartoonist "Bakuman" drawn by the same generation as Toriyama, the manga is simply divided into "king's road manga" and "evil way manga
