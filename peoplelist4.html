        <h2>Appearance and Clothing</h2>
        <div class="image_2">
            <p>
                Gohan has distinct differences from Goku in appearance, with a face similar to Goku's, and hair that grows like an Earthling's, which changes as it grows longer over time. Therefore, Gohan's hairstyle has changed since his debut. Although Gohan's hairstyle often changes due to growth and trimming, it was largely established in his youth. After becoming a scholar, Gohan wears glasses in his daily life.
            </p>
            <p>
                At his first appearance, Gohan wore a white vest with a Chinese-style jacket, with the character "Sun" engraved on the heart of the jacket. He wore a hat similar to a Qing Dynasty official's hat, with a four-star Dragon Ball on it. He wore green pants and black boots, with a white belt. After returning from the giant ape form, Piccolo made a set of clothes for him in the same style as his father, but with the character "Devil" engraved on the heart. During the Saiyan Saga, he wore the same clothes as Piccolo. In the late part of the Namek Saga, he changed to Saiyan battle clothes. In the Android Saga, he changed back to the clothes he wore when fighting Vegeta. When he entered the Spirit and Time Room for training with his father, he wore the same combat uniform as Vegeta (but without shoulder pads). After the training, Piccolo made a suit for Gohan in the same style. As he grew up, he wore a white vest with a black jacket with an orange star high school emblem on the heart, red pants, and black leather shoes. Later, to hide his identity, Bulma designed a "Masked Saiyan Superman" combat suit for him. During his training on King Kai's planet, he changed into the uniform provided by the King God, and when he returned to Earth, he changed back to the Taoist robes like his father. In his spare time, he also wore other casual clothes.

            <p>
                Future Gohan wears the same style as his father, with a blue vest and a Turtle School uniform, with the character "Rice" engraved on the back of the uniform, blue boots, and a belt wrapped around his waist, and blue wristbands on his hands.

        <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
        <div class="image_2">
            <p>
                Childhood: Due to the doting of his elders, he is quite tearful, naturally kind and not very combative, but has great potential and can exert strong power to protect himself when in danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Future Timeline: Calm, gentle, filial, kind, very polite, loyal, unyielding, and decisive. Due to the burden of saving the future alone and the pain of losing loved ones repeatedly, he is a bit more negative than the modern Gohan.
