        <h3>Rumor: The Fifth DLC of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot Will Be Set at the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament</h3>
        <p>
            According to the爆料 by user DbsHype, the fifth DLC for Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot following the "Bardock - The Father of Goku" chapter will be related to the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament from the original Dragon Ball series. Many international players regard DbsHype as a reliable source for Dragon Ball news, and he has shared leaks before the official announcement of the Bardock DLC, so his credibility is somewhat guaranteed.

            Although the universe of the plot continues to evolve, a significant part of the precious memories that the Japanese national manga Dragon Ball has left us comes from the classic chapters directed by Akira Toriyama.

            The fourth DLC for Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, "Bardock - The Final Battle Alone," will be released on January 12th (January 13th for the Western version), included in the Season Pass 2 which covers three story chapters, and is available for separate purchase. Additionally, the game will be launched on PS5 and XSX/S on the same day, with the next-gen version supporting 60 frames per second, enhanced graphics, and reduced loading times. Owners of the PS4 and Xbox One versions can upgrade for free.

            Moreover, UNIQLO has also customized a 7-piece set for loyal fans, with a box that features the "summoning of the Shenron" through AR technology, and includes 7 stickers, which is quite sincere. The new collaboration between Dragon Ball and UNIQLO UT will be officially released on May 1st, so Dragon Ball fans should get ready.
